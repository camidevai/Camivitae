### User Story
As a designer, I want the color palette and typography configured in Tailwind so that the app has a consistent "Rich Aesthetic".

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Scenario: Check Design Tokens
  Given I am inspecting "tailwind.config.ts"
  Then I should see custom colors for "primary" (Indigo) and "secondary" (Pink)
  And default fonts should be configured (Inter/Outfit)
```

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passed (NO EXCEPTIONS)
- [ ] QA Validation passed
- [ ] Tailwind theme extended with brand colors
- [ ] Fonts configured via `next/font`
- [ ] `globals.css` updated with dark mode base
